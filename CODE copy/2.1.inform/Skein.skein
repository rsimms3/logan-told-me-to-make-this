Large Lounge
Red and tan armchairs flank the giant windows, and a large couch is in front of a TV. People are studying, and a group of girls is talking far too loudly. Someone is napping in an armchair. To the WEST lies Nathan and Cameron's room.

Nathan &amp; Cameron's Room
Going past the small foyer, lies a bookshelf filled with boardgames, a small fridge, and two TVs, side by side. Two beds are lofted in the room, and a futon sits under one of them. An Asian boy is playing Overwatch on the futon, while his roommate does his homework.

You can see a TV here.

This floor is a lively place. You can hear someone crying hystetically in their room. Oh dear. Midterms are coming, after all. I wonder why the paint is missing from the wall in front of Reagan's Room to the EAST. Someone exists the Elevators to the NORTH, and heads to the large lounge in the WEST.

Reagan's Room
A girl with blue hair is sprawled on her bed, cursing at her laptop. Her bookshelf is stacked high with linguistics textbooks, and a blue-and-black mobility scooter is parked in the corner. She looks irritated at being interrupted. Better leave, then.

There lies, right next to the bed, a locked navy blue trunk. A mug of tea and a box of cookies sits on the trunk.

On the locked oversized trunk are a mug of tea and a box of cookies (closed).

You can also see Mobility Scooter (on which is a basket (in which is an i-Card)) here.
